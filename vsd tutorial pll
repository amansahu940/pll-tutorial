INTRODUCTION: If to access any application on mobile ,laptops or any electronics device,we can access it through hardware called CHIPS.
              to cop up with these applications we need semiconductor chips , and so here PLL come into role play.

basically compiler converts high level language to low level language and assembler take it down to further to convert it into binary.
 
 CHIP is basically called the package

package is generaaly the gateway for us to access the chip sitting inside
and there are Pads available for CORE for connecting it to the package 
also there is a die - space b|w core and die which we fabricate

NOW coming to the IP-INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
it is basically a reuasable unit of logic by which we can save the designing and testing time by just inserting the verified ones and to respect the MOORE's LAW.

to understand the IP first we need to understand the ON CHIP CLOCK MULTIPLER
basically it is a multiplier which just multiplies the source frequency (low HZ) to the high (hz) frequency  ,known as PLL.
NOWADAYS Processor works at a frequency of 5 GHZ,MHZ and the generated source frequency is low thetas why we need a PLL.

 __source frequency gives the input to PHASE DETECTOR
 __PHASE DETECTOR gives the input to the LOW PASS FILTER in the form of DC PULSES,WAVEFORM
 __LOW PASS FILTER converts it into the dc value for VOLTAGE CONTROLLER OSCILLATER(VCO).
 __if vco recieves low dc value then there will be low frquency generated if more dc value vice versa..
 __FREQUENCY COUNTER basically divides the frequency into 2,4,8...
 
 COMING TO CMOS IMPLEMENTATION:

 upper is the PMOS which is of less mobility 
 lower is the NMOS which is of high mobility
 
 so we have to give the extra charge to pmos to mke it feasibily work with nmos
pmos width=360nm,L=180nm
nmos width=180nm,L=180nm

sometimes if pmos connected in parallel and 
nmos connected in series so NMOS add up 
and PMOS give one equivalent value 
so NMOS can be given higher width to make them both work together.

OPERATION OF FEEDBACK LOOP : the output is given back to input so generally it gives the error so basically the circuit works in critically damped condition
which means it will be settled in less time and variations in the output will also be less.

NOW COMING TO IC FABRICATION PROCESS:
when fabricated on silicon it all connect wit a sort of wire so it should'nt be too long as it increases the resistance
and it should'nt be connected more in parallel with each other ,leads to increases in capacitances.

NOW EULER PATH- It helps in making the connection of ic optimal by considering the path ways of gates of pull upand pull down network at the time layout.
