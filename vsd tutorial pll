INTRODUCTION: If to access any application on mobile ,laptops or any electronics device,we can access it through hardware called CHIPS.
              to cop up with these applications we need semiconductor chips , and so here PLL come into role play.

basically compiler converts high level language to low level language and assembler take it down to further to convert it into binary.
 
 CHIP is basically called the package

package is generaaly the gateway for us to access the chip sitting inside
and there are Pads available for CORE for connecting it to the package 
also there is a die - space b|w core and die which we fabricate
