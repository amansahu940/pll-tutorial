INTRODUCTION: If to access any application on mobile ,laptops or any electronics device,we can access it through hardware called CHIPS.
              to cop up with these applications we need semiconductor chips , and so here PLL come into role play.

basically compiler converts high level language to low level language and assembler take it down to further to convert it into binary.
 
 CHIP is basically called the package

package is generaaly the gateway for us to access the chip sitting inside
and there are Pads available for CORE for connecting it to the package 
also there is a die - space b|w core and die which we fabricate

NOW coming to the IP-INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
it is basically a reuasable unit of logic by which we can save the designing and testing time by just inserting the verified ones and to respect the MOORE's LAW.

to understand the IP first we need to understand the ON CHIP CLOCK MULTIPLER
basically it is a multiplier which just multiplies the source frequency (low HZ) to the high (hz) frequency  ,known as PLL.
NOWADAYS Processor works at a frequency of 5 GHZ,MHZ and the generated source frequency is low thetas why we need a PLL.

 __source frequency gives the input to PHASE DETECTOR
 __PHASE DETECTOR gives the input to the LOW PASS FILTER in the form of DC PULSES,WAVEFORM
 __LOW PASS FILTER converts it into the dc value for VOLTAGE CONTROLLER OSCILLATER(VCO).
 __if vco recieves low dc value then there will be low frquency generated if more dc value vice versa..
 __FREQUENCY COUNTER basically divides the frequency into 2,4,8...
 
 COMING TO CMOS IMPLEMENTATION:
